Just run the script "world.js" from "tools" -> "Run Script..." in WorldPainter.
Be sure to place all images, layers and terrain in the right folders.
But first change the "path" variable to match your folder with the script and files.

1:4000 = 3 min / 2,1GB RAM

1:2000 = 14 min / 5,7GB RAM

1:1000 = 62 min / 19,1GB RAM
