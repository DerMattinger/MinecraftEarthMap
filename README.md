# MinecraftEarthMap
WorldPainter Script and Heightmaps for generating an earth map for Minecraft

Just run the script "world.js" from "tools" -> "Run Script..." in WorldPainter.
Be sure to place all images, layers and terrain in the right folders.
But first change the "path" variable to match your folder with the script / files.

## Manuell operations after running the script

- change terrain of desert, desert_lakes, desert_hills to red_sand on Australia
- Remove the Border and Cities Layers (if you want)
